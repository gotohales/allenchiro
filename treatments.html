              <p>Dr Allen will develop a program of care that may combine more than one type of treatment, depending on your personal needs. In addition to manipulation, the treatment plan may include mobilization, massage or rehabilitative exercises, or something else.</p>
              <h3>Back Pain</h3>
              <p>31 million Americans experience low-back pain at any given time.</p>
              <p>Low back pain is the single leading cause of disability worldwide and one-half of all working Americans admit to having back pain symptoms each year.</p>
              <p>Back pain is one of the most common reasons for missed work.</p>
              <p>Most cases of back pain are mechanical or non-organic—meaning they are not caused by serious conditions, such as inflammatory arthritis, infection, fracture or cancer.</p>
              <p>Experts estimate that as many as 80% of the population will experience a back problem at some time in our lives.</p>
              <p>The back is a complicated structure of bones, joints, ligaments and muscles. You can sprain ligaments, strain muscles, rupture disks, and irritate joints, all of which can lead to back pain. While sports injuries or accidents can cause back pain, sometimes the simplest of movements—for example, picking up a pencil from the floor— can have painful results.</p>
              <p>Arthritis, poor posture, obesity, and psychological stress can cause or complicate back pain.</p>
              <p>Chiropractic spinal manipulation is a safe and effective spine pain treatment. It reduces pain, decreases medication, rapidly advances physical therapy, and requires very few passive forms of treatment, such as bed rest.</p>
              <p>The Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research recommended spinal manipulation as the only safe and effective, drugless form of initial professional treatment for acute low back problems in adults.</p>
              <p>American Medical Association also suggested chiropractic care as an option for people suffering from low back pain--and noted that surgery is usually not needed and should only be tried if other therapies fail.</p>
              <h3>Tips for Preventing Back Pain</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Maintain a healthy diet and weight.</li>
                <li>Remain active—under the supervision of your doctor of chiropractic.</li>
                <li>Avoid prolonged inactivity or bed rest.</li>
                <li>Warm up or stretch before exercising or other physical activities, such as gardening.</li>
                <li>Maintain proper posture.</li>
                <li>Wear comfortable, low-heeled shoes.</li>
                <li>Sleep on a mattress of medium firmness to minimize any curve in your spine.</li>
                <li>Lift with your knees, keep the object close to your body, and do not twist when lifting.</li>
                <li>Work with your Dr Troy Allen to ensure that your computer workstation is ergonomically correct.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Headaches and Migraines</h3>
              <p>Nine out of ten Americans suffer from headaches. Some are occasional, some frequent, some are dull and throbbing, and some cause debilitating pain and nausea.</p>
              <p>Research shows that spinal manipulation is  an effective treatment option for tension headaches and headaches that originate in the neck or base of the skull.</p>
              <p>Researchers at the Duke University  found that spinal manipulation resulted in almost immediate improvement for those headaches that originate in the neck, and had significantly fewer side effects and longer-lasting relief of tension-type headache than a commonly prescribed medication.</p>
              <p>Headaches have many causes, or “triggers.” These may include foods, noises, lights, stress, and/or behaviors. About 5 percent of all headaches are warning signals caused by physical problems.</p>
              <p>Ninety-five percent of headaches are primary headaches, such as tension, migraine, or cluster headaches. These types of headaches are not caused by disease. The headache itself is the primary concern.</p>
              <h3>Tips for preventing Headaches and Migraines</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>If you spend a large amount of time in one fixed position, such as in front of a computer, typing or reading, take a break and stretch every 30 minutes to one hour. The stretches should take your head and neck through a comfortable range of motion.</li>
                <li>Low-impact exercise may help relieve the pain associated with primary headaches. However, if you are prone to dull, throbbing headaches, avoid heavy exercise. Engage in such activities as walking and low-impact aerobics.</li>
                <li>Avoid teeth clenching. The upper teeth should never touch the lowers, except when swallowing. This results in stress at the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) – the two joints that connect your jaw to your skull – leading to TMJ irritation and a form of tension headaches.</li>
                <li>Drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day to help avoid dehydration, which can lead to headaches.</li>
                <li>Chiropractic adjustments improve spinal function and alleviate the stress on your system.</li>
                <li>Muscle re-education and relaxation techniques help reduce muscle tension and spasming that causes headaches and migraines.</li>
                <li>Allen Chiropractic Care can offer advice on posture, ergonomics (work postures), exercises and relaxation techniques. This advice should help to relieve the recurring joint irritation and tension in the muscles of the neck and upper back.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Growing Older</h3>
              <p>Osteoarthritis, a common joint disorder, causes progressive deterioration of cartilage. The body reacts by forming bone spurs that affect joint motion.</p>
              <p>Spinal stenosis causes the small nerve passageways in the vertebrae to narrow, compressing and trapping nerve roots. Stenosis may cause neck, shoulder, and arm pain, as well as numbness, when these nerves are unable to function normally.</p>
              <p>Degenerative disc disease can cause reduction in the elasticity and height of intervertebral discs. Over time, a disc may bulge or herniate, causing tingling, numbness, and pain that runs into the arm.</p>
              <h3>Chiropractic Advice for Moms-to-Be</h3>
              <p>The muscle strains of pregnancy are very real and can be more than just a nuisance. The average weight gain of 25 to 35 pounds, combined with the increased stress placed on the body by the baby, may result in severe discomfort.</p>
              <p>Studies have found that about half of all expectant mothers will develop low-back pain at some point during their pregnancies.This is especially true during late pregnancy, when the baby's head presses down on a woman's back, legs, and buttocks, irritating her sciatic nerve.</p>
              <p>During pregnancy, a woman's center of gravity almost immediately begins to shift forward to the front of her pelvis. As the baby grows in size, the woman's weight is projected even farther forward, and the curvature of her lower back is increased, placing extra stress on the spinal disks.</p>
              <p>Pregnancy hormones help loosen the ligaments attached to the pelvic bones. But even these natural changes designed to accommodate the growing baby can result in postural imbalances, making pregnant women prone to having awkward trips and falls.</p>
              <h3>Exercise</h3>
              <p>Safe exercise during pregnancy can help strengthen your muscles and prevent discomfort. Try exercising at least three times a week, gently stretching before and after exercise. If you weren't active before your pregnancy, check with your doctor or chiropractor before starting or continuing any exercise.</p>
              <p>Walking, swimming, and stationary cycling are relatively safe cardiovascular exercises for pregnant women because they do not require jerking or bouncing movements. Jogging can be safe for women who were avid runners before becoming pregnant-if done carefully and under a doctor's supervision.</p>
              <p>Be sure to exercise in an area with secure footing to minimize the likelihood of falls. Your heart rate should not exceed 140 beats per minute during exercise. Strenuous activity should last no more than 15 minutes at a time.</p>
              <p>Stop your exercise routine immediately if you notice any unusual symptoms, such as vaginal bleeding, dizziness, nausea, weakness, blurred vision, increased swelling, or heart palpitations.</p>
              <h3>Health and Safety</h3>
              <p>Wear flat, sensible shoes. High or chunky heels can exacerbate postural imbalances and make you less steady on your feet, especially as your pregnancy progresses.</p>
              <p>When picking up children, bend from the knees, not the waist. And never turn your head when you lift. Avoid picking up heavy objects, if possible.</p>
              <p>Get plenty of rest. Pamper yourself and ask for help if you need it. Take a nap if you're tired, or lie down and elevate your feet for a few moments when you need a break.</p>
              <h3>Pregnancy Ergonomics: Your Bed and Desk</h3>
              <p>Sleep on your side with a pillow between your knees to take pressure off your lower back. Full-length "body pillows" or "pregnancy wedges" may be helpful.</p>
              <p>If you have to sit at a computer for long hours, make your workstation ergonomically correct. Position the computer monitor so the top of the screen is at or below your eye level, and place your feet on a small footrest to take pressure off your legs and feet. Take periodic breaks every 30 minutes with a quick walk around the office.</p>
              <h3>How Can Your Doctor of Chiropractic Help?</h3>
              <p>Many pregnant women have found that chiropractic adjustments provide relief from the increased low-back pain brought on by pregnancy. Chiropractic manipulation is safe for the pregnant woman and her baby and can be especially attractive to those who are trying to avoid medications in treating their back pain. Doctors of chiropractic can also offer nutrition, ergonomic, and exercise advice to help a woman enjoy a healthy pregnancy.</p>
              <p>Chiropractic care can also help after childbirth. In the eight weeks following labor and delivery, the ligaments that loosened during pregnancy begin to tighten up again. Ideally, joint problems brought on during pregnancy from improper lifting or reaching should be treated before the ligaments return to their pre-pregnancy state-to prevent muscle tension, headaches, rib discomfort, and shoulder problems.</p>
